The model below shows the process hierarchy model and provides an example for each level - the process model consists of six levels.

**1. Level 0 – Line of Business**

A high-level aggregation of company functionality (core ore support functionalities, depending on the view of processes to be analyzed).

**2. Level 1 – Process Group**

A bundle of processes that belong to the same area of responsibility dealing with similar tasks and activities for functional or other reasons.

**3. Level 2 – Scope Item**

The Business Process is the level that aggregates business oriented functions or steps to a unit that is meaningful and comprehensive in the sense that the steps or functions incorporated are essential to fulfill a business mission related task. 

i. e. a Business Process is defined by steps that transform an input into an enriched output.

**4. Level 3 – Scope Item Variant**

The Process Variant is meant to fulfill the same business mission but in a different manner or with a different application compared to a Business Process. 

i.e. Input and Output are more or less the same but the way to reach the output is different.

Each Business Process (or variant) consists of process steps. The steps itself contain activities performed by an user or a system in order to fulfill the business mission.

**5. Level 4 – Process Step**

An activity performed by a user or a piece of software together with other Process Steps forming a Business Process or a Business Process Variant i. e. Business Processes do consist of more than one process step.

A Process Step is an activity that is related to exactly one object (e.g. human, sheet of paper, purchase order (system) ...). A Process Step is typically executed by one person and documented using an appropriate representation of the object (paper, data in IT-system...).

From a user interaction point of view a Process Step is a single work task in a causal work flow without role change. A Process Step is typically identified by the fact that the task owner has got all necessary responsibilities to execute the task. A Process Step can be performed by a human being alone or by an interaction between human/system and system/system.
