Business processes can get quite complex and this makes it tough to model a real big process into just one graphical model. It makes no sense to model an end-to-end-process like “order to cash” into just one graphical model comprising everything like “article selection to shopping cart”, “submission of purchase order”, “money transfer”, “packaging”, “logistics” etc.

A process hierarchy is necessary to divide complex processes into smaller parts. A process hierarchy follows the “from abstract to concrete” principle. This means it provides information about the processes on different levels of granularity. Therefore, it is possible to get information about the abstract value chain (e.g. Purchasing, Production, Sales) or about very specific process steps and their logical order (e.g. create customer, approve purchase order). A process hierarchy is defined by its levels and the information given in these levels.

It is key to have a defined information base on each level (e.g. a process step is always performed by a specific role instead of an abstract organizational unit), otherwise process models won’t be comparable at a later stage.
