Change Impact Analysis is defined as analysing the impact of changes within the deployed product or application. It gives information about the areas of the system that may be affected due to the change in the section or features of the application. The impact is analysed on Requirements, Design & Architecture, impact on Test, and impact on the schedule. With the addition of new features into an application or product, it is necessary to check the influence of the changes or new features on the performance of the system. This is the reason for performing Change Impact Analysis. Continuous software testing through process automation and sophisticated model-driven functionality, helps organizations create and deliver new technology to drive innovation and enable intelligent enterprise operations. But in distributed and interconnected digital ecosystems, new solutions and software changes can have unintended or unexpected results that can affect crucial business processes. 

The main objective of change impact analysis in the SAP world is to: 

1. Find risks to business processes posed by standard or custom changes to your SAP software 

2. Enable continuous software testing and innovation and prioritize high-risk areas 

3. Improve testing speed and efficiency
