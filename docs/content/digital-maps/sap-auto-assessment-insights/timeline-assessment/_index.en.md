</br>1. The SAP S/4HANA assessment report enables you to understand the implications of the transition from an existing SAP ERP system to S/4HANA. It  outlines the timeline (1) and effort estimation for the SAP S/4HANA conversion project.

</br>2. The Roadmap Guide module of KTern provides an automated high-level roadmap of the SAP S/4HANA system conversion process.

</br>3. The Solution Architects and the Project Managers can then validate the roadmap and proceed with the system conversion project.

</br>4. After assessing an SAP ECC landscape completely, KTern auto-generates a roadmap and timeline for your S/4HANA conversion. 

</br>5. This roadmap/timeline is custom-made for your system only. It takes system complexity, customizations, add-ons, integrations and enhancements into account and then comes up with the timeline.

</br>6. KTern also provides a detailed timeline of each of the sub-phases of the project with their start and end date.

</br>7. The Solution Architects and Project Managers can use this rough project roadmap and chart out a detailed plan for the conversion.

</br>8. As seen in the above image, KTern provides an approximate timeline for the sandbox conversion, development conversion, quality conversion and production system conversion.

</br>**i. Sandbox Conversion:**
<ul>
<li>
Generally, a sandbox conversion takes around two to three months depending on the system complexity and takes the longest time of all conversion runs.
</li></br>
<li>
Sandbox conversion is done on a system with production data. A sandbox conversion helps you identify and understand the actual changes in the data model. 
</li></br>
<li>
You may have faced several errors, installed various notes, abided by SAPâ€™s best practices during the Sandbox conversion.
</li>
</ul>

</br>**ii. Development System Conversion:**
<ul>
<li>
A quality system conversion takes lesser time than a development conversion. 
</li></br>
<li>
You must convert the existing ECC quality landscape into S/4HANA quality landscape.
</li>
</ul>

</br>**iii. Production Conversion:**
<ul>
<li>
In this stage, the final production landscape of the ECC system is converted to S/4HANA. 
</li></br>
<li>
With this the system conversion project is completed.
</li>
</ul>
