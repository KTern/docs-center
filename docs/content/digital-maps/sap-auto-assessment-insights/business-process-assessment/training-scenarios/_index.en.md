</br>1. More often than not, we only focus on the day-to-day details and nuances of a system conversion project. We spend several months on the transformation project. 

</br>2. In the meantime, we forget the actual people who are going to use the software after Go-Live. They are given just a few days of generic, end-user training. 

</br>3. But a complex project like S/4HANA conversion requires much more than that. It requires a mindset shift – from viewing a S/4HANA transformation as just a standard ERP upgrade to using it to succeed in the complex digital economy.

</br>4. It is necessary to have all the end-users on board before the start of the implementation itself. You must train them right from the start and not keep them in the dark. 

</br>5. This will help them appreciate the necessity of change. Once you convince the end-users and employees of how the change will make their lives simpler, the adoption, utilization and success of the new S/4HANA software will follow quickly.

</br>6. View the top 3 relevant modules for training and the detailed training recommendations by clicking on the launch icon (18).

</br>7. Therefore, as the first step, KTern provides training scenario recommendations in the Discover phase of the Activate Methodology itself to help plan your transition and the change management better.

</br>8. KTern’s Training Scenario Recommendations feature analyses the connected system. It automatically identifies the business processes which have undergone changes in S/4HANA. 

</br>9. You must train the end-users to adopt these changes. KTern also identifies the relevant training scenarios along with the stakeholders who must be trained. 

</br>10. This will enable the Project Managers to keep an eye on the training of the end-users and effectively govern the change management process.

</br>11. The objective of the training scenario recommendations is to identify the enablement scope for end-user training. It involves the following steps:
<ul>
</br>i. Run the first assessment on the training requirements which arises from the SAP transition project.

</br>ii. Gather information about the SAP S/4HANA system conversion project, and identify affected organizational units.

</br>iii. Conduct interviews regarding training strategy elements.

iv. Identify training relevant user groups (Project Team, Key User, End User).

</br>v. Evaluate the high-level enablement scope for End User Training.
</ul>

</br>12. As seen in the below picture, KTern provides an analytical view of the number of training plans and the training scenarios. It also provides a distribution of the training scenarios by the respective modules.

</br>13. Hence, it gives a fair idea to the Project Managers about the most impacted modules and the most relevant modules for training.

</br>14. KTern analyzes and documents the training requirements for the key users and end-users. KTern automatically provides the training scenarios for each module based on the impact of change in S/4HANA. 

</br>15. It provides a clear description, status of each training scenario in S/4HANA, and the reference SAP Notes (which has all the changes with respect to that business process).

</br>16. One of the most important features of KTern’s training scenario recommendation is that it identifies the key stakeholders of each business process. They are ranked based on their usage of each scenario. 

</br>17. For example, all the MM consultants use Goods Withdrawal process of Material Management module. This functionality is unavailable in S/4HANA, but an equivalent exists. 

</br>18. Hence, you must train the end-users to adopt the new process. KTern provides a list of all the users who use this process and ranks them hierarchically according to their usage. 

</br>19. The consultant who uses this process/scenario the most receives Rank 1, the next user receives Rank 2 and so on. Hence, based on this analysis, you can design and execute a training plan in the subsequent phases of the project.

</br>20. The stakeholders can then create a training event and assign it to the relevant functional and technical consultants. The training event will contain all the relevant training materials and documents for a particular scenario.

</br>21. Additionally, the stakeholders can also upload files and create CTA’s. Hence, they can monitor the training process throughout the duration of the system conversion project.

</br>22. This initial enablement assessment is the analysis of learning and enablement related aspects of Digital Learning in general and with respect to your actual situation. 

</br>23. The assessment helps to get an understanding of the general learning management situation, your enablement capabilities to support the digital transformation process and the alignment with the project scope and timeline. 

</br>24. Based on the results of the training scenario recommendations, specific training management activities will be identified. KTern also provides recommendations to enable a successful enablement delivery. 

</br>25. It is particularly relevant at the beginning of a project. Doing this analysis in the Discover phase itself helps the project managers to determine the timeline and effort required for training.

</br>26. End-user training is a very manual process. All users are given generic training at the end of the project. 

</br>27. But, with KTern, you can have a clear overview of who should be trained, when they should be trained and in what they should be trained. 

</br>28. Even after the Go-Live of the system conversion project, users can undergo continuous training in the application itself. Hence, it saves a lot of time & effort and all the users are given relevant training only.

</br>29. And, the best part is that no other contemporary product in the market offers Training Recommendations.
