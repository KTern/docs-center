</br>1. KTern.AI drills down the enterprise structure of each module or Line of Business in the existing system, aiding in an organized S/4HANA migration. 

</br>2. It helps in understanding the type and orientation of the SAP system and also to identify the most effectively used processes and organizational units.

</br>3. In most SAP S/4HANA assessments, as the first step, organizations aim to find out the enterprise structure in SAP and drill down the hierarchy of each functional module. 

</br>4. They seek answers to questions like:
<ul>
</br>i. What is the type of the system? 
</br>ii. What is the orientation of the SAP system?
</br>iii. How and who uses the system? 
</br>iv. What are the most effectively used processes? 
</br>v. How many company codes are there in the system? 
</br>vi. What are the most effectively used sales organizations/ purchase organizations? And much more.
</ul>

</br>5. It drills down from company codes, sales organizations, distribution channels, plants and all the way up to the sales documents generated. 

</br>6. In this way, KTern provides a clear hierarchy and evidently maps the organizational structure. KTern performs the same for 
<ul>
</br>i. Purchase Documents
</br>ii. Order Documents
</br>iii. Sales Documents
</br>iv. Billing Documents and others as well based on the available data. 
</ul>

</br>7. KTern also provides the option of downloading this report. Additionally, you can also post it in the forum, assign stakeholders and collaborate. 

</br>8. You can upload the files in KTern and subsequently use them at any other stage of the system conversion process. 

</br>9. Thus, KTern provides a platform to join forces and work together in determining the relevant enterprise structures in SAP and plan the path to S/4HANA.

</br>10. Another important use case of this feature is that you can perform a pre-Go-Live check in a greenfield implementation. 

</br>11. In a greenfield implementation, the customer usually provides the configuration requirement. The System Integrator then maps the enterprise structure according to the configuration and tests them accordingly. 

</br>12. Enterprise Structure Mining feature of KTern can be used to audit the configured landscape. This allows the customer to Go-Live with the system without any apprehensions.
