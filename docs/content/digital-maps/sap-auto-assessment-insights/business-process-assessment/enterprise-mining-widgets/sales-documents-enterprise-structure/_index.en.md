</br>1. KTern’s Enterprise Structure Mining – Sales documents feature drills down into various organizational units. 

</br>2. Each module in SAP has its own enterprise structure. An Enterprise Structure in SAP is nothing but the framework or structure according to which the whole business runs. 

</br>3. And every organization has, or at least should have some structure. There are several organizational units within an enterprise structure.

</br>4. An enterprise structure in SAP clearly defines the numerous levels in an organization. Each level has a distinct functionality associated with it, and the levels are categorized according to some hierarchy. The levels, when combined, describe the working of an organization. 

</br>5. The Sales and Distribution module in SAP has the following organizational units:

<ul>
i. Sales Organization
</br>ii. Distribution Channel
</br>iii. Sales Office
</br>iv. Division
</br>v. Sales Group
</br>vi. Company Code (maintained by Finance module)
</br>vii. Plant (maintained by MM module)
</br>viii. Storage location (maintained by PM module)
</br>ix. Sales Area

</br>6. The box displays the total count of Sales Documents. Click on the launch icon (12) adjacent to Sales Documents to explore a tree view showcasing the complete history of purchase documents.

</br>7. By clicking on the node corresponding to the company code, the Enterprise Structure of the Sales documents is drilled down from company codes, sales organziation, distribution channel, division, plant, and all the way up to the count of created sales documents.

</br>8. As seen in the abovepicture, KTern’s Enterprise Structure Mining feature drills down into various organizational units. 

</br>9. In this way, KTern provides a clear hierarchy and evidently maps the organizational structure. The hierarchy of a sales organization is as follows:

**Company Code -> Sales Organization -> Distribution Channel -> Division -> Plant -> Number of Sales Documents Generated**

</br>10. The functional consultants manually doing this task will definitely not be able to provide such clarity and accuracy in mapping the organization structure. 

</br>11. They have to go through each table, record and t-code to get this information. And even then, they will not be able to get the total picture. 

</br>12. And, let’s not talk about the time required to complete the task. It may take several weeks or even months to complete it. 

</br>13. Typically, in most S/4HANA assessments, as the first step, organizations aim to find out the enterprise structure in SAP and drill down the hierarchy of each functional module. 

</br>14. They find out answers to questions like:
<ul>
i. What is the type of the system? 
</br>ii. What is the orientation of the SAP system? How and who uses the system?
</br>iii. What is the most effectively used process? 
</br>iv. How many company codes are there in the system? 
</br>v. What are the most effectively used sales organizations? And much more.
Finding out answers to these questions is a very manual task.
</ul>

</br>15. Many functional consultants are deployed for this purpose. The functional consultants then go through each t-code, table and report to map the hierarchy of the enterprise structure in SAP and find out the complexity of the system. 

</br>16. Sounds tiring, right? But this step is mandatory and cannot be skipped. Only after this step, you can proceed with the next step in the system conversion process.

</br>17. With KTern, you can automate and find out the entire enterprise structure in SAP with just the click of a button. 

</br>18. You can find the answers to the above crucial questions easily. This feature is in the Discover phase of the Activate Methodology and is covered in the Impact Analysis module of KTern.

</br>19. KTern automates the task and provides the results in a span of few minutes.

</br>20. Another important feature of KTern’s Enterprise Structure Mining is that you can sort and search the company codes, sales organizations, distribution channels, divisions, plants and the number of sales documents. 

</br>21. This enables you to determine the most active company codes, sales organizations and so on. 

</br>22. For example, if only two sales documents are generated for the past 5 years in one of the plants, then it can be inferred that that particular plant is not active. 

</br>23. After taking a call with the business stakeholders, you need not move that particular plant to S/4HANA. 

</br>24. You can gain such insights only when you have such detailed hierarchy and organizational mapping as provided by KTern. 

</br>25. Such observations from KTern helps the functional consultants, business stakeholders from both the System Integrator side and the customer side, and the Solution Architects to have a clear picture of the landscape and take better data-driven decisions.
