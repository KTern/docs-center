<ul>

</br>**i. Change of existing functionality**
Simplification items in this category refer to functions that are generally available in some form in SAP S/4HANA but have been adapted in such a way that might affect existing processes and custom programs.

</br>**ii. Functionality unavailable (equivalent exists)**
Simplification items in this category refer to functions that are not available in SAP S/4HANA. However, the equivalent functionality is available in SAP S/4HANA.

</br>**iii. Functionality unavailable (no equivalent)**
Simplification items in this category refer to functions that are not available in SAP S/4HANA. And, there is no equivalent functionality available. If you think that such impacted items are critical to your business, then it makes sense to wait until SAP releases that functionality and then make the move to S/4HANA.

</br>**iv. Non-Strategic Functions (equivalent exists)**
SAP has identified many of the existing core ECC modules/sub-modules/functionalities as "non-strategic" in S/4HANA. If current ECC-users or new businesses require these functionalities which are part of a "non-strategic module/functions" then they have to adopt the "strategic solution" as per S/4HANA roadmap. These "strategic-solutions" may or may not have its equivalent in S/4HANA. Generally, the non-strategic functions with equivalents can be classified into: oNew S/4HANA solutions part of extended S/4HANA product or oIn some cases, existing SAP products which are being enhanced/built for S/4HANA.

</br>**v. Non-Strategic Functions (no equivalent):**
The Simplification Items where these "strategic-solutions" have no equivalent in S/4HANA are classified into this category.
