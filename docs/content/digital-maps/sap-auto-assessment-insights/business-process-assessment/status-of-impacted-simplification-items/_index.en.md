## Simplification Item Check

</br>1. The Simplification List describes the potential adaptation work that is required to convert your SAP ERP system to SAP S/4HANA at a functional level. 

</br>2. Simplification list items (for short, Simplification Items) illustrate the business adaptation requirements and effects to custom developments for each function described. 

</br>3. For more complex modifications, the Simplification Items provide the relevant guides to support your transformation.

</br>6. The Simplification Item list is an essential early-stage tool used for planning an SAP S/4HANA Conversion project. 

</br>7. Many necessary adaptations can be implemented on the existing SAP ERP source system itself. As a result, you will be able to begin an SAP S/4HANA Conversion Project even before installing the software in the first place. 

</br>8. Consequently, the Simplification Item List is an essential source of information to organize crucial project tasks and assign the required resources.
