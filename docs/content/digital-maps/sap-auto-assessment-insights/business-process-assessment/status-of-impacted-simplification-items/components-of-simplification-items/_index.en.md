<ul>

</br>**i. Business Impact Note:** The Business Impact Note describes how that particular Simplification Item impacts the system as well as the business processes.

</br>**ii. Source Release and Target Release:** The source and target release outline the basic relevant information; For instance, an item is said to be relevant if the customer comes from the source release and goes to the target release maintained in that Simplification Item.

</br>**iii. Check:** Checks in a Simplification Item provides more relevant information like table checks for certain content, activated business functions etc. In addition, if a Simplification Item is relevant, you can also check the consistency. In other words, the check analyzes the prerequisite conditions in the system.
</ul>

</br>2. Typically, each Simplification Item consists of an SAP OSS Note. The OSS Note has the description and details on how to run that Simplification Item. 

</br>3. You have to install the OSS Note into the system and run the Simplification Items Check. However, with KTern, you can automate the process of Simplification Item Check and it provides a comprehensive overview of all the relevant simplifications for SAP S/4HANA – that is, all mandatory solution adjustments in a system conversion project.

</br>4. KTern covers the Simplification Item check in its Impact Analysis module. It is one of the preliminary and vital steps in a system conversion project and comes in the Discover phase itself. 

</br>5. The Simplification Item check covers the relevancy of the Simplification Items in the target SAP S/4HANA system. 

</br>6. This analysis, combined with the productivity and collaboration features of KTern such as forum, discussions and stakeholder management, forms a potent formula to get started with the SAP S/4HANA system conversion.

</br>7. The forum provides a platform within KTern to collaborate, announce and have discussions regarding the simplification items and also assign them to the respective stakeholders. 

</br>8. In addition, you can also upload files and track the work item hierarchy within KTern itself. Several useful Simplification Item links and references are also provided as part of the Knowledge Base called “S/4HANAPEDIA” within KTern.

</br>9. KTern's Simplification Item check calculates the total number of Simplification Items in a system. It then classifies them into impacted and non-impacted Simplification Items. 

</br>10. KTern also provides the status of each Simplification Item with SAP Note references. 

</br>11. It also specifies why a particular Simplification Item is relevant or not relevant to your business.
