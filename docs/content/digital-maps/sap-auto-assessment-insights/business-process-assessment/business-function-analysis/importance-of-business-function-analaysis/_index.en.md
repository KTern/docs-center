### Mitigating Risks and Assessing Readiness: Importance of Business Function Analysis in SAP S/4HANA Migration

</br>1. If one of your critical add-ons is not compatible with S/4HANA, then your entire business could be at risk. 

</br>2. In such cases, you will have to wait for SAP’s roadmap to make that particular add-on compatible with S/4HANA. Only then, you can plan your transition from ECC to S/4HANA.

</br>3. Before migrating to SAP S/4HANA, it is mandatory to assess the existing ECC landscape including your business processes, business functions, custom codes, architecture, and user interface. 

</br>4. This enables you to take a data-driven approach to S/4HANA. KTern’s Business Function Analysis feature analyzes all the business functions installed in an ECC system in the Discover phase itself. 

</br>5. It then classifies them into active and inactive business functions. 

</br>6. The main objective of this feature is to analyze the impact of migrating these active business functions to S/4HANA. 

</br>7. If any critical active business function is not compatible with S/4HANA, then you cannot migrate to S/4HANA. 

</br>8. Business Function Analysis is part of the Impact Analysis module of KTern.
