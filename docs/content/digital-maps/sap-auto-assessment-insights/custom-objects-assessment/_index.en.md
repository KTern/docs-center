</br>1. Every organization is unique and has its own business process. SAP’s standard software cannot cover all the business processes completely. 

</br>2. Therefore, to meet the individual requirements of organizations, the standard SAP software is customized or adapted to suit the business needs. You can enhance SAP’s standard software through custom objects.

</br>3. The Custom Objects Assessment comprises the number of custom objects, custom packages, and significant reports/transactions in the assessed system.

</br>4. What will happen to these customizations when you migrate from SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA? KTern performs the Custom Objects Assessment precisely to find out this information.

</br>5. KTern automates the process of SAP custom object analysiss. As a result, this section gives you an analytical view of the custom objects present in the system. 

</br>6. After connecting an ECC system, KTern runs the custom object analytics check and determines the custom objects present in a system. You can gain analytical insights on the following:
<ul>
i. Most relevant Custom packages with respect to the number of objects
</br>ii. Frequently used custom transactions/reports
</br>iii. Top x custom object stakeholders
</br>iv. Top x custom object types
</br>v. Top SAP Reference Notes for impacted cases
</br>vi. Change of existing functionality, and much more
</ul>

</br>7. KTern also provides a summary of the Enhancements and Modifications that are going to be impacted during the transition from ECC to S/4HANA. This is particularly helpful because there is only a minute difference between Enhancements and Modifications.

</br>8. **Enhancement** in SAP is adding or modifying the logic of SAP standard program without modifying the standard object. It consists of customer exit, Business Transaction Event (BTE) and Business Add-Ins (BADI).

</br>9. **Modification** in SAP is adding or modifying the logic of standard program by modifying SAP standard object.

</br>10. Another fascinating feature of KTern’s Custom Objects Assessment is that is gives a summary of all the impacted cases as well as the optimization cases based on the level of impact – 
<ul>
i. High impact
</br>ii. Medium impact 
</br>iii. Low impact
</ul>

</br>11. This will help you to prioritize the highly impacted custom objects first.

</br>12. KTern provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis of each impacted custom program and custom object. Based on the information provided by KTern, you can plan your SAP S/4HANA Migration with confidence.

</br>13. You can easily estimate the required amount of time and effort for the conversion, the number of resources required, the number of mock-conversion runs to be planned etc. 

</br>14. You can prioritize your custom code remediation. The high frequency, high impact score custom code and objects can be remediated first. 

</br>15. You can also archive certain unused custom objects after evaluating its functional importance and taking a call with the business stakeholders.
