</br>1. In the case of S/4HANA system conversion, you must analyse the existing SAP ERP users and their license types. 

</br>2. KTern automates this process. It finds out the total number of SAP ERP users and also classifies them into active and inactive users based on their activity. 

</br>3. As a result, this section gives you an analytical view of all the users present in the system and helps you make the right decision with respect license purchase before moving to S/4HANA.

</br>4. This feature of KTern is essentially used by Project Managers and key stakeholders on the customer side. It enables them to have a thorough understanding of their ECC landscape and their licensing model. 

</br>5. The main purpose of this feature is to determine the number and type of licenses you need to purchase before moving to S/4HANA. Performing this analysis before that move provides a significant advantage in planning your system conversion. That’s why this feature is included in the Discover phase itself.

</br>6. A Digital Transformation project is not dependent only on data and process flows alone. One of the critical factors for the success of any Digital Transformation project is active collaboration among stakeholders.
