SAP S/4HANA operates exclusively on Linux operating systems. Unlike its previous releases, which allowed the use of any database, SAP S/4HANA can only run on the SAP HANA Database, known for its powerful real-time performance. This verification process, known as the OS and DB compatibility check, helps customers ascertain the compatibility of their operating system and database.

The system profiling encompasses the following:

Verification of your current operating system
Verification of your current database
Determination of whether your system is Unicode
Identification of whether your system is running on a Single Stack or Dual Stack
Analysis of your peak usage and database performance
Assistance in planning your database sizing based on year-on-year database growth.
