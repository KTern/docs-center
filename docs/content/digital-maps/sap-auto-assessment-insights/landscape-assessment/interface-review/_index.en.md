</br>1. SAP Interfaces offer the possibility of connecting external systems to ECC. When you transition from ECC to S/4HANA, you are only changing the Digital Core. 

</br>2. Hence, these interfaces should work the same way as they did before. Therefore, KTern performs the Interface Review check to determine whether the connection to S/4HANA is compatible.

</br>3. The various areas of interfaces that KTern.AI covers would be :
<ul>
i. RFC Communications
</br>ii. HTTPs Communications
</br>iii. Logical Systems
</br>iv. Webservices
</br>v. TCP/IP Connections
</br>vi. Namespace (Addon)
</ul>

</br>4. Trigger the launch icon (6) to access an analytical horizontal bar chart displaying the available connection types.
