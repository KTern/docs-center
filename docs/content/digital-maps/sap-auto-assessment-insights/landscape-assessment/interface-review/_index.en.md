### Interfaces Review

SAP Interfaces offer the possibility of connecting external systems to ECC. When you transition from ECC to S/4HANA, you are only changing the Digital Core. Hence, these interfaces should work in the same way as they were before. Therefore, KTern performs the Interface Review check to determine whether the connection to S/4HANA is compatible.

The various areas of interfaces that KTern.AI covers would be :

RFC Communications
HTTPs Communications
Logical Systems
Webservices
TCP/IP Connections
