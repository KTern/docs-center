</br>1. Your transition from ECC to S/4HANA can stop in its tracks if there is an incompatible add-on. All add-ons must be certified in order to run on S/4HANA. 

</br>2. For SAP’s own add-ons or the ones sold through SAP’s pricelist, you can directly request the status of add-ons and additional packages from SAP themselves. However, SAP is not responsible for the independent third-party add-ons.

</br>3. KTern automates the process of add-on compatibility checks during the SAP S/4HANA assessment,  eliminating the need for installing any SAP Notes in the system. 

</br>4. After the system connection, KTern automatically runs the compatibility checks and classifies installed add-ons as either compatible and incompatible.

</br>5. Click on the launch icon (4) to access an analytical horizontal bar chart displaying the present software types.

### Process of Add-on Analysis
<ul>
i. First, you need to check the add-ons which are compatible and incompatible for the S/4HANA version you are targeting. The compatible add-ons can be migrated to S/4HANA without any trouble.

</br>ii. For incompatible add-ons, you must notify SAP or third-party vendors. Advance notification will enhance the chances of your add-ons certification in time for your implementation/ deployment.

</br>iii. You can contact third-party software vendors of incompatible add-ons and ask them to accelerate their certification process.

</br>iv. You can uninstall the add-ons which are not in use.
</ul>

</br>5. The Add-on compatibility check is a critical feature within KTern’s Impact Analysis module, integral to the Discover phase of the SAP Activate methodology.

</br>6. KTern automates the add-on compatibility check process to identify  incompatible add-ons with S/4HANA and assess their impact on the transition.

</br>7. KTern automates the add-on compatibility check process without requiring the installation of any SAP Notes. 

</br>8. Upon system connection, KTern conducts the compatibility checks and categorizes installed add-ons into compatible and incompatible ones. 

</br>9. KTern also categorizes add-ons into three broad categories:
<ul>
i. Software components
</br>ii. Installed products
</br>iii. Correction packages
</ul>

</br>10. Performing an add-on compatibility check is crucial before migrating to S/4HANA, allowing safe migration of compatible add-ons.

</br>11. In case a critical add-on is incompatible with S/4HANA, waiting for SAP’s roadmap for compatibility is necessary before planning the transition from ECC to S/4HANA.

</br>12. Basis consultants perform the add-on compatibility check, and the results are evaluated by respective functional consultants. 

</br>13. For example, in SAP ECC treasure management is part of the Finance (FI) module. However, in S/4HANA, it is a separate add-on and cannot function independently. Therefore, finance consultants evaluate this specific impact.
