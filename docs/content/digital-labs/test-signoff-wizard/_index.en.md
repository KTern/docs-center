</br>1. Testing is one aspect of S/4HANA migration which can extend the timeline of the project since it involves a lot of ambiguity. 

</br>2. No matter how well you document a test case and raise defects, there’s always some sort of difference or ambiguity between the system integrator and the customer. 

</br>3. KTern’s sign-off wizard provides a way to ensure transparency among the key decision makers.

</br>4. KTern allows you to create multiple sign-off items and map multiple test cases under each sign-off item. 

</br>5. There is one root node from which sign-off items can be created for each scenario and sub-scenario.

</br>6. The respective stakeholders can approve these sign-off items hierarchically.

</br>7. Then, the testers, test-engineers, department heads, project managers and project champions from both the system integrator side and the customer side can approve these sign-off items. 

</br>8. This ensures complete visibility and transparency. 

</br>9. Also, there will be fewer problems during cut-over orchestration.
