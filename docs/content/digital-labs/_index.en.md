1. KTern is an automated digital workplace for SAP Digital Transformations. 

2. With decades' worth of SAP Tribal knowledge combined with automation, governance and collaboration capabilities, KTern is built to help the existing ECC customers migrate to S/4HANA. 

3. KTern covers the entire lifecycle and guides you before, during, and after the conversion. 

4. Its inbuilt S/4HANAPEDIA rule engine combined with several modules eases the transition from SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA.

5. **Digital Labs** of KTern is tightly integrated with Digital Projects hub, which is the project management suite.

6. Typically, the testers would be testing the various test cases on one side and the governance would take place via emails, chat, or any other project management tool. 

7. The whole process was cumbersome and arduous for all the stakeholders involved. 

8. Therefore, we developed Digital Labs of KTern to execute, manage and collaborate all the testing related activities of an S/4HANA migration (or upgrade project) from a single place.

<!-- **Test Strategy:** The Test strategy outlines the testing approach and everything else that surrounds it. It is different from the Test Plan, in the sense that a Test strategy is only a subset of the test plan. It is a hardcore test document that is to an extent generic and static. There is also an argument about at what levels test strategy or plan is used- but I really do not see any discerning difference. -->
