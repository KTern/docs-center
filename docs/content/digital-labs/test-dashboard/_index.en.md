</br>1. The Test Suite is a container that has a set of tests which help the testers in executing and reporting the test execution status. 

</br>2. It can take any of the three states i.e. Active, in progress and completed. 

</br>3. The Dashboard has two tabs:
<ul>
i. Test Cases</br>
ii. Defects</br>
</ul>

#### Status of Work Items
