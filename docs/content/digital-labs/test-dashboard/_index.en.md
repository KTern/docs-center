1. The Test Suite is a container that has a set of tests which help the testers in executing and reporting the test execution status. 

2. It can take any of the three states i.e. Active, in progress and completed. 

3. The Dashboard has two tabs:

        i. Test Cases
        ii. Defects

#### Status of Work Items

1. In KTern Dashboard, you can also find the breakdown of test cases and defects by status.

2. It gives a graphical representation of the new, active, performed and approved test cases/defects. 

3. It also represents the split of these work items by modules.

4. Also, selecting "Overdue Data" will display the corresponding data on the chart.

#### Resource Utilization Table

1. This table provides an overview of all the stakeholders and testers involved in the project.

2. It has a list of all the testers working in the project along with the number of test cases allocated to them. 

3. It also tracks the progress of each stakeholder with respect to test case execution.

4. Thus, the test suite dashboard becomes the one dashboard using which the project manager can monitor all the test cases and progress of testing process as a whole, in the project.
