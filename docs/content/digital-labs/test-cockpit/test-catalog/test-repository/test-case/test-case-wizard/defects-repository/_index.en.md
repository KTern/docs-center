</br>1. There is a separate defects repository in the test case wizard from where you can create issues/defects related to the test cases.

</br>2. A Defect in Software Testing is a variation or deviation of the software application from end userâ€™s requirements or original business requirements. 

</br>3. A software defect is an error in coding which causes incorrect or unexpected results from a software program which does not meet actual requirements. 

</br>4. Testers might come across such defects while executing the test cases.

</br>5. A defect/ issue is primarily created when a test case execution has failed. 

</br>6. While creating a defect/ issue, you can assign stakeholders, planned vs actual dates and map the created defect to a particular test case. 

</br>7. Therefore, in this way, KTern provides a way for all the project managers, test engineers and key stakeholders to operate from one place and one place only.
