## A. Test Suite Cockpit

The testing lifecycle is governed by the Test Suite Cockpit, which includes the Test Catalog, Insights, Test Suite Dashboard, and Sign-Off Wizard.

![2-test-cockpit-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle](https://storage.googleapis.com/ktern-public-files/product-documentation/Digital%20Labs/2-test-cockpit-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle.png)

### I. Test Catalog

Easy test execution is enabled by the Test Catalog, which serves as a comprehensive list of test plans (1), scenarios (2), and cases (3). It organizes test items hierarchically, simplifying navigation and execution for the user.

![3-test-catalog-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle](https://storage.googleapis.com/ktern-public-files/product-documentation/Digital%20Labs/3-test-catalog-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle.png)

### Test Case Wizard

Clicking and launching any test case from the test catalog automatically directs the user to the Test Case Wizard.

## a. Test Center

Important details about test cases, such as their status, priority, and test type, are provided in the Test Center tab (4) in KTern.

It serves as a central hub for managing and collaborating on test cases. Users can access information like wiki notes, references, work item hierarchy, descriptions, stakeholders, planned (date, environment, location) vs actual (date, environment, location) and more.

![6-test-center-1-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle](https://storage.googleapis.com/ktern-public-files/product-documentation/Digital%20Labs/6-test-center-1-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle.png)


The Test Center eliminates the need for multiple communication channels and tools, offering instant access and streamlined activities.

## b. Test Lab

Test cases are executed in the Test Lab tab (5) in KTern. It ensures a systematic and thorough validation of the application or system being tested.
The Test Lab also allows for defining the test environment and managing test scripts and logs.

a. **Test scripts** help govern the testing lifecycle by providing a structured approach, reducing planning and execution time, and facilitating collaboration among teams. Test scripts, which provide step-by-step instructions and expected results, are created and executed in the Test Lab.

b. The **Test execution log** captures comprehensive records of test steps, outcomes, and failure reasons, providing detailed documentation for auditing, reporting, and future reference. It enables analysis to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement. Test execution logs are captured, allowing for analysis and decision-making based on the test results.

![10-test-lab-test-execution-log-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle](https://storage.googleapis.com/ktern-public-files/product-documentation/Digital%20Labs/10-test-lab-test-execution-log-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle.png)

### c. Defects Repository

KTern's test case wizard includes a separate defects repository (6) for managing issues related to test cases. 

![11-defects-repository-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle](https://storage.googleapis.com/ktern-public-files/product-documentation/Digital%20Labs/11-defects-repository-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle.png)

Users can create, assign stakeholders, and track defects that arise during test case execution.

This centralized repository streamlines defect management and promotes collaboration among project managers, test engineers, and stakeholders.

### d. History

KTern captures a comprehensive history (7) log that tracks all changes made to test cases, providing valuable insights into their evolution and updates over time.

![12-history-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle](https://storage.googleapis.com/ktern-public-files/product-documentation/Digital%20Labs/12-history-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle.png)

### II. Insights

Users can track and report on test completion in the Insights section of the Test Suite Cockpit.

It provides comprehensive information about test plans, test scenarios, and test cases, ensuring transparency and a thorough understanding.
Users can access charts that display assigned test cases for each team member and apply filters using the "Wheel" icon.

![13-insights-1-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle](https://storage.googleapis.com/ktern-public-files/product-documentation/Digital%20Labs/13-insights-1-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle.png)

Additionally, they have the flexibility to add new reports and customize their names. Insight reports can be downloaded in Excel format.

## B. Analytics or Test Suite Dashboard

The Analytics section can be accessed either by clicking on the Dashboard or selecting Analytics from the dropdown menu on the left. 

### I. Status of work items

It allows users to view the status of work items and resource utilization of the test cases and defects.

The Test Suite Dashboard in KTern acts as a centralized hub for project managers, offering a comprehensive platform to monitor test cases and track the testing process's progress.

This dashboard provides a visual representation of test cases and defects, allowing project managers to easily assess their status.

![15-dashboard-status-of-workitems-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle](https://storage.googleapis.com/ktern-public-files/product-documentation/Digital%20Labs/15-dashboard-status-of-workitems-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle.png)

Moreover, it offers a breakdown of work items categorized by modules, business processes, and testing types, providing a structured view of the tasks involved.

This feature enables project managers to efficiently oversee and manage the testing activities within the project.

### II. Resource Utilization Table

The Resource Utilization Table in KTern offers a comprehensive overview of project stakeholders and testers involved in the project.

![16-dashboard-resource-utilization-table-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle](https://storage.googleapis.com/ktern-public-files/product-documentation/Digital%20Labs/16-dashboard-resource-utilization-table-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle.png)

It displays the allocation of test cases to each individual tester for test case execution.

This table allows you to easily track and manage the distribution of test cases among team members, ensuring efficient utilization of resources and facilitating effective coordination within the testing process.

## C. Signoff Wizard

KTern's signoff wizard enables the creation of multiple signoff items and mapping of multiple test cases within each signoff item.

![17-signoff-wizard-1-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle](https://storage.googleapis.com/ktern-public-files/product-documentation/Digital%20Labs/17-signoff-wizard-1-how-to-govern-your-testing-life-cycle.png)
