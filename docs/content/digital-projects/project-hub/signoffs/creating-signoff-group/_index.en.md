Here are the steps you can follow to **create signoff group** using KTern:

a. To create a signoff item, it is necessary to have at least one existing signoff group. You have the option to assign the signoff item to either a newly created signoff group or an existing one.

b.	To create a new signoff group, click on the signoff section of your project, and then click the “+” icon to add a new group.
