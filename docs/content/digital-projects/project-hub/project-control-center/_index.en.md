**Overview:** 
Users encounter three pivotal tabs. The first, labeled ***Overview*** sheds light on elements lying beyond the control of the Project Team, acting as constraints that may limit available options. This tab also accommodates assumptions and constraints, derived from the Discovery and Evaluation Phase, allowing for further development. Moving to the ***Scope*** tab, users gain insights into SAP solutions within scope, as well as a high-level depiction of the project's overall scope.
