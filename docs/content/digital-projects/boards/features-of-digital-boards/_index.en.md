The <b>Clone and Create method</b> involves categorizing tasks based on global scope items and parent tasks. Subsequently, a board is automatically generated based on this categorization. The tasks under this can be seen under active boards or C & C boards based on its status.

<li>
The <b>Custom method</b> allows users to create their own boards, along with tasks and assigning them to stakeholders or themselves. This is particularly useful for creating personalized to-do lists. The tasks under this can be seen under active boards or custom boards based on its status.
